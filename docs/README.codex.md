# Superpowers for Codex

Guide for using Superpowers with OpenAI Codex via native skill discovery.

## Quick Install

Tell Codex (replace with the raw URL for this repo’s `.codex/INSTALL.md`):

```
Fetch and follow instructions from <YOUR_RAW_CODEX_INSTALL_MD_URL>
```

## Manual Installation

### Prerequisites

- OpenAI Codex CLI
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_SUPERPOWERS_CODEX_REPO_URL> ~/.codex/superpowers-codex
   ```

2. Create the skills symlink:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
   ln -s ~/.codex/superpowers-codex/skills ~/.agents/skills/superpowers
   ```

3. Restart Codex.

### Windows

Use a junction instead of a symlink (works without Developer Mode):

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills"
cmd /c mklink /J "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills\superpowers" "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\superpowers-codex\skills"
```

## How It Works

Codex has native skill discovery — it scans `~/.agents/skills/` at startup, parses SKILL.md frontmatter, and loads skills on demand. Superpowers skills are made visible through a single symlink:

```
~/.agents/skills/superpowers/ → ~/.codex/superpowers-codex/skills/
```

The `using-superpowers` skill is discovered automatically and enforces skill usage discipline — no additional configuration needed.

## Usage

Skills are discovered automatically. Codex activates them when:
- You mention a skill by name (e.g., "use brainstorming")
- The task matches a skill's description
- The `using-superpowers` skill directs Codex to use one

### Personal Skills

Create your own skills in `~/.agents/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills/my-skill
```

Create `~/.agents/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Use when [condition] - [what it does]
---

# My Skill

[Your skill content here]
```

The `description` field is how Codex decides when to activate a skill automatically — write it as a clear trigger condition.

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/.codex/superpowers-codex && git pull
```

Skills update instantly through the symlink.

## Uninstalling

```bash
rm ~/.agents/skills/superpowers
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills\superpowers"
```

Optionally delete the clone: `rm -rf ~/.codex/superpowers-codex` (Windows: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\superpowers-codex"`).

## Troubleshooting

### Skills not showing up

1. Verify the symlink: `ls -la ~/.agents/skills/superpowers`
2. Check skills exist: `ls ~/.codex/superpowers-codex/skills`
3. Restart Codex — skills are discovered at startup

### Windows junction issues

Junctions normally work without special permissions. If creation fails, try running PowerShell as administrator.
